I am an experimental psychologist and behavior analyst, having led behavioral and neurophysiological research for presidential and government campaigns in Spain 🇪🇸, Argentina 🇦🇷, Guatemala 🇬🇹, Bolivia 🇧🇴, the United States 🇺🇸, and México 🇲🇽.

Specializing in optimizing messages and multimedia content to effectively communicate with target audiences, I have also developed statistical techniques for predicting voting behavior based on baseline surveys and daily tracking.

My work and research have earned me various awards and recognitions due to the implementation of behavioral technology as one of the most accurate methods for winning an election.

**Personal Blog**

Welcome to my personal blog. Here, I enjoy sharing some of the tools I use daily and the process I follow to implement solutions to problems that don't exist. Essentially, this is an experimental and collaborative space open to any project that includes open-source code, data, and behavior.

Mostly, you will find:

* Infographics and DataViz 📊 📈
* Tutorials 🧑‍💻
* Maps 🗺️
* Sustainable Mobility 🚲
* Metro/Subway/Trains 🚇

I am always available, except when I'm not.
