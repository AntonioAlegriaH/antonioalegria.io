[Topi Tjukanov](https://twitter.com/tjukanov) started the challenge in 2019 on Twitter.   

>The idea is to create maps based around different themes each day of November using the hashtag #30DayMapChallenge. You can prepare the maps beforehand, but the main idea is to publish maps on the dedicated days. Just include a picture of the map when you post to Twitter (or other platforms) with the hashtag. You don't have to sign up anywhere to participate. There are no restrictions on the tools, technologies or the data you use in your maps. Doing less than 30 is also fine.

This post will archive my personal progress. 


## Day 1: Points

>Street tree data from the TreesCount! 2015 Street Tree Census, conducted by volunteers and staff organized by NYC Parks & Recreation and partner organizations. Tree data collected includes tree species, diameter and perception of health.

## Day 2: Lines

>The Nazca Lines are a group of geoglyphs made in the soil of the Nazca Desert in southern Perú. They were created between 500 BCE and 500 CE  by people making depressions or shallow incisions in the desert floor, removing pebbles and leaving differently colored dirt exposed. There are two major phases of the Nazca lines, Paracas phase, from 400 to 200 BCE, and Nazca phase, from 200 BCE to 500 CE. In the years leading up to 2020, between 80 and 100 new figures had been found with the use of drones, and archaeologists believe that there are more to be found.

## Day 4: Green

>Argentinian Yerba Mate it's a plant grown and processed in the provinces Misiones y Corrientes. The leaves can be steeped in hot water to make a beverage known as mate. Brewed cold, it is used to make tereré. The flavor resembles an infusion of vegetables, herbs, and is reminiscent of some varieties of green tea. According to data from the Departamento de Estimaciones Agricolas and Instituto de la Yerma Mate, between 1969 to 2019, Argentina produced more than 20 million tonnes of yerba.

## Day 7: Raster

**1:10m Ocean Bottom**

>Blended depth colors and relief shading of the ocean bottom derived from CleanTOPO2 data. The ocean color extends beneath land areas as a flat tint—mask it with the 10m Natural Earth vector shoreline, or a shoreline from another data source.
